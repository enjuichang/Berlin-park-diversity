# Avifauna Diversity in Berlin Urban Park 

This repo shows the R code for the working paper "Avifauna Richness in Berlinâ€™s Urban Parks". We used AIC as the metrics and linear regression models to find the main predictor for avifauna richness in Berlin's urban parks. Data was collected from [eBird](https://ebird.org/region/DE-BE?yr=all) and [Berlin Senate](https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp), which was then processed through **QGIS** for buffer analysis of park perimeters and habitat type counting.
